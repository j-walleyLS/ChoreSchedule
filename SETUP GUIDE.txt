# Quick Setup Guide

## Step 1: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

1. Save all the files to a folder on your computer
2. Open terminal/command prompt in that folder
3. Run:
   ```
   pip install streamlit pandas
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Name it something like "cleaning-schedule"
   - Make it Public
   - Don't initialize with README (we have one)

2. In your terminal, in the folder with your files, run:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cleaning-schedule.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

## Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (FREE!)

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click "Sign in with GitHub" and authorize
3. Click "New app"
4. Fill in:
   - Repository: Select your cleaning-schedule repo
   - Branch: main
   - Main file path: app.py
5. Click "Deploy!"

Your app will be live at: `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.streamlit.app`

## Troubleshooting

- **"Git not found"**: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- **"Permission denied"**: Make sure you're logged into GitHub in your terminal
- **App won't deploy**: Check that requirements.txt is in the root directory

## Customizing Your Schedule

Edit `app.py` and look for these sections:
- `morning_tasks` - Change your morning routine
- `evening_tasks` - Change your evening routine  
- `weekly_tasks` - Modify weekly tasks and days
- `monthly_tasks` - Customize monthly cleaning by month

After making changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Updated tasks"
git push
```

Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy!
